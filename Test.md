    <ul>
        <li>Connect with your TTD representative for any paperwork needed for audience activation.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the Segment IDs being used exist in your TTD account. If not, create the Segment and communicate the Segment ID to the data provider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To send data to your first-party data segments using MadConnect, you will need the following to authenticate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertiser ID</li>
        <li>Advertiser Secret Key</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div style="width:80%; margin: 10px auto">
    <p>You can obtain your decoded advertiser secret key for uploading first-party data from your advertiser preferences page in The Trade Desk UI; Advertiser Preferences > Seat Identifiers & Keys. If you can't find your secret key, contact your Account Manager. When you send data, the included secret key is validated against the secret key the platform has on file for the Advertiser ID.</p>
